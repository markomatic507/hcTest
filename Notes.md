# Notes

~~Check if it is possible just to get to a page and get the HTML~~ Authwall

~~Check for exploits to avoid login step. Found exploit with Google Mobile-Friendly test. It is possible to feed it link and extract LinkedIn HTML without login step.~~ Captcha

Use puppeteer and log the user and get data in this way.

**Scraping violates LinkedIn terms of service**

To minimize the chances of a ban limit the number of tests. I will avoid automated testing.

Should I store the persistent data or just cache it? Cache it.

Should I persist the user login and store it with JWT and sessions or not? 

Should I do the front-end design or just use the bootstrap? Bootstrap.

Is there a way to speed up the app???
